<h>GTK Adapter for android</h>
--
  * A view is a world of gtk.
  * The simplest goal is to make exist applications which are developed for GTK be able to execute on android.
  * This adapter should provide a simple interface to connect touch event to the underlying gtk, so that underlying can use mouse callback to handle the touch event.
  * It should provide a simple way to capture the framebuffer of the view, so that superior layer, android can apply post-filter onto the frame.
